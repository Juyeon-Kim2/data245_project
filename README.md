# Resume Update Recommendation System

## Project Overview
Our group is working on the "Resume Update Recommendation" project. The main challenge of preparing the right resume for a job is the significant amount of time required to edit and refine it. This is because even similar positions, like software engineering roles, can have vastly different requirements depending on the company. For example, an AI-focused company might look for skills in machine learning or deep learning, whereas a software application company might prioritize experience with frontend frameworks.

## Our Goal
We aim to build a system where users can submit their resumes and receive recommendations on sentences or keywords to add. This enhancement is designed to increase the likelihood of their resumes being selected for interviews. Our system intends to save users time on editing and enable them to present their resumes more professionally.

## Significance
We believe that a well-designed system can be extremely beneficial to all working professionals by automating part of the resume tailoring process. For our team, this project is not only a potential tool for our own use, given our numerous other academic responsibilities, but also a means to alleviate the burden of resume editing, allowing us more time to focus on school assignments and quizzes.
